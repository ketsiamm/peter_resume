__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?__

_ compared to the average of my name in history which is 4955.21 my name during my birth year is with a total 3137 is below the average  _

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
#| tbl-cap: "Peter in history"
# Include and execute your code here


peter_in_history = df.query('name == "Peter"')
# average = peter_in_history['Total'].mean()
# average
peter_in_history



```

## QUESTION|TASK 2

__If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of his or her age? What ages would you not guess?__

_ My guess is that she was probably born in 1990, and she is 34 years old because that is the year that had the highest record of people born named Brittany. I wouldn't guess that she was born in 1971 and that she is 51 because that is the year with the lowest record of people named Brittany. _

```{python}
#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
#| tbl-cap: "table of Brittany all over the years"
# Include and execute your code here
brittany = df.query('name == "Brittany"')# query all the brittany
brittany_max = brittany[['year','Total']]# query the brittany their birth year and the ttal name for that year
brittany_max

```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}
#| label: Q2 chart

# Include and execute your code here
chart = px.bar(
    brittany,
    x="year",

).add_bar(x =[1990],y=[32562.5],marker_color = 'green', name ='highest Brittany from 1970 to 2015')

# Include and execute your code here

brittany_max_total = brittany_max[brittany_max['Total'] == brittany_max['Total'].max()].filter(['year', 'Total'])

brittany_max_total# return the year with the most Brittany

```
